[Seam](https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam) is a personal wiki system based
on [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/).

## Installation
Clone this repo and add it to your load path.  As long as your system
has `find` and `grep` installed, no further setup should be required.

## Documentation
For now, the best way to learn about Seam is the [project
page](https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam) and the
[tutorial](https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam-tutorial).  I have
endeavored to make Seam fairly self-documenting, so also see the
docstrings and the Seam customization group.
