## A personal wiki toolkit for Emacs

Seam leverages the power of [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) to make
creating, linking, and exporting your notes easier.  It is geared
particularly towards creating a personal wiki â€” a place where you can
share some portion of your notes with the world.  It takes inspiration
from the likes of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and
[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).

Three of Seam's key design tenets are:

- Org files and their resultant HTML files should always be kept in
  sync.
- It should be easy to create multiple sites using different subsets
  of the same note collection.
- Notes should not be unnecessarily clouded with metadata.

Be aware that Seam is a fully self-contained package, and is not
likely to be compatible with things like
[Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) due to its vastly different
approach.

### Getting started

The easiest way to begin is to follow the brief
[tutorial](https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam-tutorial).

### Documentation

Seam's manual is still being written.  In the meantime, the [project
page](https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam) contains some more tidbits you
might find useful.

I have endeavored to make Seam fairly self-documenting, so check the
docstrings and the Seam customization group when in any doubt.
