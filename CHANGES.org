** Changes since 0.1.0

*** Breaking changes

- Code has been moved to =lisp/= subdirectory, where it should have
  been all along.  Make sure to add =seam/lisp= to your =load-path=
  instead of just =seam=.

**** Renamed functions

- =seam-replace-string-in-notes= is now =seam-replace-string-in-all-notes=.

- =seam-visited-files= is now =seam-visited-notes=.

*** New features

- Option to export internal links with a custom CSS class
  (=seam-export-internal-link-class= / =:internal-link-class=).

- =SEAM_SLUG= property can be added to title headline to set a custom
  slug.

*** Improvements

- Notes are no longer re-exported unnecessarily whenever a linked note
  is changed.

- Title is now mentioned when deleting a note, to make it less likely
  you delete the wrong one by mistake.

- Completion support is somewhat improved.  =ido-completing-read= now
  works properly, and Seam no longer binds =completion-ignore-case=.

*** Bugfixes

- =seam-visited-notes= no longer returns buffers visiting non-note
  files within the Seam directory.

- Buffer titles are now set correctly from narrowed buffers.

- An issue with regexp escape sequences being interpreted in template
  variable replacements has been fixed.

- Seam now validates note types entered with =C-u seam-set-note-type=,
  averting any mishaps if your completing-read function returns an
  invalid type.

- It is no longer possible to create a note with an empty slug.
