[[https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam][Seam]] is a personal wiki system based on [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].

** Installation
Clone this repo and add it to your load path.  As long as your system
has =find= and =grep= installed, no further setup should be required.

** Documentation
For now, the best way to learn about Seam is the [[https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam][project page]] and the
[[https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam-tutorial][tutorial]].  I have endeavored to make Seam fairly self-documenting, so
also see the docstrings and the Seam customization group.
