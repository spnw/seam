** A personal wiki toolkit for Emacs

[[https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam][Seam]] leverages the power of [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] to make creating, linking, and
exporting your notes easier.  It is geared particularly towards
creating a personal wiki â€” a place where you can share some portion of
your notes with the world.  It takes inspiration from the likes of
[[https://obsidian.md/][Obsidian]] and [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki][MediaWiki]].

Three of Seam's key design tenets are:

- Org files and their resultant HTML files should always be kept in
  sync.

- It should be easy to create multiple sites using different subsets
  of the same note collection.

- Notes should not be unnecessarily clouded with metadata.

Be aware that Seam is a fully self-contained package, and is not
likely to be compatible with things like [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] due to its vastly
different approach.

*** Getting started

The easiest way to begin is to follow the brief [[https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam-tutorial][tutorial]].

*** Documentation

Seam's manual is still being written.  In the meantime, the [[https://wiki.plexwave.org/seam][project
page]] contains some more tidbits you might find useful.

I have endeavored to make Seam fairly self-documenting, so check the
docstrings and the Seam customization group when in any doubt.

*** Known issues

- =find-file= does not create notes properly.  You should use
  =seam-find-note= instead.

- Commented-out links are not ignored, e.g. for determining backlinks.

- Tags in note title headlines are not ignored; they are treated as
  part of the title.

*** Upgrading

As a new project, Seam is very much in flux.  Whenever you upgrade it,
please see the [[file:CHANGELOG.org][changelog]] for breaking changes, new features, etc.
